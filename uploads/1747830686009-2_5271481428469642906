Summary
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
We're seeking a fast, clean, and secure way to integrate  test results from a specific API into our WordPress website. The goal is to create a modern, Apple-inspired dashboard for logged-in customers that displays all of their emmissions device results and emails them automatically when new test results are available.

We’re open to plugin-based OR external solutions, as long as the experience is seamless and maintainable via WordPress.

OBJECTIVES:

Display all devices linked to a customer account inside WordPress.

Show real-time or near real-time  test results.

Trigger an email notification when a new result is received.

Provide an Apple-style UI (clean, simple, responsive).

Deliver the solution within 7 days max.

PREFERRED SOLUTION OPTIONS:

A. WordPress Plugin (Preferred):

Custom plugin coded in PHP/JS that fetches and displays API data.

Includes admin panel for API keys, user-device linking, and email setup.

Uses cron job or webhook (depending on API) for real-time sync.

Includes shortcode or template override for front-end display.

B. Headless/API Integration via REST:

Use a front-end JS app (React, Vue, or AlpineJS) embedded in a WordPress page.

JS directly calls the API (securely via proxy/middleware).

WordPress handles auth, layout, and content management.

Hosted externally or as a headless module inside WP.

C. External Microservice + iFrame Embed:

Build a lightweight external app

Display user’s device dashboard via secure iframe in WordPress.

Authenticate user via token passed from WP session.

Useful for rapid scaling or isolating the logic from WP entirely.

CORE FEATURES:

API Integration: Securely connect to  API using bearer token. Display results per device (VIN, test result, date).

User Dashboard: Show all devices linked to account.

Email Automation: Send branded email when a new result is detected for a user’s device.

Admin Controls (if plugin): API key config, device-user linking, email settings.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

Clean, mobile-first layout inspired by Apple and Tesla UIs.

Simple cards per truck/device: VIN, result, date/time, "View Details" button.

Clear color codes (green/pass, red/fail, gray/pending).

TIMELINE:

Project start: ASAP

Ideal Delivery: within 7 working days


DELIVERABLES:

Working solution integrated into WordPress (plugin or external method)

Email system in place

Admin setup/config area (or deployment instructions)

User-facing dashboard
